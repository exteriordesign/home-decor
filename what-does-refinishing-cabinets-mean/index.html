<p>Refacing kitchen cabinets and resurfacing them pretty well mean the same thing. Kitchen cabinet refinishing means that you keep all components of your existing cabinetry and simply change the color or the finish which is often completed via hand sanding or chemically stripping the existing finish from the wood, then applying new paint or stain. The cabinet boxes, called the cases, stay in their current layout, but get a new finish with veneer. Not to mention you add another step to your process that can add a bottleneck. Whether you decide to paint or reface, putting a fresh look on those tired old cabinets is a cheap way to update your kitchen. You can use new paint colours to brighten the room.</p>
