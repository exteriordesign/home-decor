Some people still believe that the most expensive models in a range offer the best build quality. We have just had a quote from howdens for our kitchen in both the glendevon and burford styles. Diy kitchens were more expensive when i got a quote from them for the same units. All other appliances (cooker, extractor, integrated fridge freezer, sink) we bought.</p>
