<p>The ikea akurum kitchen was discontinued in early 2015 with door fronts for the cabinet system being discontinued in october, 2015. In factum cabinet height was 70cm so you have 70cm door for wall unit or full height floor. Thanks for sticking with me for what we hope was an entertaining and educational. So i decided to buy all white cabinets and drawer fronts.</p>

<p>Well congrats on making it through ikea kitchen cabinets 102! Ikea launched its current kitchen range metod in 2014, replacing faktum. We used the ikea kitchen cabinets not only for our kitchen, but for our laundry room and two bathrooms as well! We wrote an entire blog post about the issue we’re running into with custom cabinet doors or drawer fronts from one of our favorite vendors, semihandmade. Ikea has a good selection of cabinet fronts, but they didn’t have exactly what i was looking for. Custom our kitchen cabinets prob would have run us over $40,000 but ikea kept it around $15,000 (boxes, custom fronts and nice pulls).</p>
